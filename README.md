A simple fast paced action platformer created using GDScript for [Lospec 2 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/lospec-jam-2)
it's currently targeted for LS16 Home Console (Lospec 2 Console) with 256x224 Resolution,
strict color pallete, a limited sound channel, control and more.

## Features

As LS16 Home Console is a rather limited console, and limited time by us due to university assignment, the game currently contains following features :

- 2 types of enemies
- 1 Boss
- 4 Unique BGM
- A rudimentary score system
- 2 Pick up able item
- Perma death (Be careful)

And for mechanics, figure it out yourself:)
